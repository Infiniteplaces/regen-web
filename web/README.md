This is a small prototype app that so far allows one to draw a polygon on a map.

The next steps will be to be able to store and save the polygon and share other
details about the land being referenced.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Maps are served via
[Map Tiler](https://www.maptiler.com) and displayed with
[mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js). The drawing controls
are provided by [mapbox-gl-draw](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw).
